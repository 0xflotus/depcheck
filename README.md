# depcheck

Easily check your npm dependencies in order to get rid of unused ones. Bonus: it checks for `grunt.loadNpmTasks` and `grunt.tasks.loadNpmTasks` too, so there shouldn't be any false positives.

## Installation

`npm install depcheck -g`

## Usage

As easy as `depcheck [DIRECTORY]`.

Where DIRECTORY is the root directory of your application (where the package.json is).
